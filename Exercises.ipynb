    "14) 99 Bottles of Beer\" is a traditional song in the United States and Canada. It is popular to sing on long trips, as it has a very repetitive format which is easy to memorize, and can take a long time to sing. The song's simple lyrics are as follows: \"99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.\" The same verse is repeated, each time with one fewer bottle. The song is completed when the singer or singers reach zero. Your task here is write a Python function `beers99` with no input arguments capable of generating all the verses of the song. Use a counter integer variable and a while loop. Make sure that your loop will come to an end and that the inflection of the word bottle is adapted to the counter!"

    "16) ROT13 is a way to encode secret messages in cryptography. The name comes from Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals. ROT13 (\"rotate by 13 places\") is a widely used example of a Caesar cipher. The idea is to rotate or augment the position of each character in the alphabet with thirteen places. Your task in this exercise is to implement an encoder/decoder of ROT-13. For this, you will need to create a list containing each letter in the (lowercase) roman alphabet as well as the whitespace character. Next, you will have to create an encode_dict and a decode_dict. Once you're done, you will be able to read the following secret message: \"Pnrfne pvcure? V zhpu cersre Pnrfne fnynq!\" (Hint: you can use .index() to retrieve the position of an item in a list!)"
